Mateme is a simple patient registration application written in Ruby on
Rails and is intended as a web front end for OpenMRS.
</p>
<p>
OpenMRSÂ® is a community-developed, open-source, enterprise electronic
medical record system framework. We&#8217;ve come together to specifically
respond to those actively building and managing health systems in the
developing world, where AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria afflict the lives
of millions. Our mission is to foster self-sustaining health information
technology implementations in these environments through peer mentorship,
proactive collaboration, and a code base that equals or surpasses
proprietary equivalents. You are welcome to come participate in the
community, whether by implementing our software, or contributing your
efforts to our mission!

Mateme was built by Baobab Health and Partners in Health in Malawi, Africa.
