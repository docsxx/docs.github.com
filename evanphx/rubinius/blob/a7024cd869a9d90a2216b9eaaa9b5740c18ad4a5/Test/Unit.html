  <h1>Test::Unit - Ruby Unit Testing Framework</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Unit testing is making waves all over the place, largely due to the fact
that it is a core practice of XP. While XP is great, unit testing has been
around for a long time and has always been a good idea. One of the keys to
good unit testing, though, is not just writing tests, but having tests.
What&#8217;s the difference? Well, if you just <em>write</em> a test and
throw it away, you have no guarantee that something won&#8217;t change
later which breaks your code. If, on the other hand, you <em>have</em>
tests (obviously you have to write them first), and run them as often as
possible, you slowly build up a wall of things that cannot break without
you immediately knowing about it. This is when unit testing hits its peak
usefulness.
</p>
<p>
Enter Test::Unit, a framework for unit testing in Ruby, helping you to
design, debug and evaluate your code by making it easy to write and have
tests for it.
</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
Test::Unit has grown out of and superceded Lapidary.
</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>
I like (and do my best to practice) XP, so I value early releases, user
feedback, and clean, simple, expressive code. There is always room for
improvement in everything I do, and Test::Unit is no exception. Please, let
me know what you think of Test::Unit as it stands, and what you&#8217;d
like to see expanded/changed/improved/etc. If you find a bug, let me know
ASAP; one good way to let me know what the bug is is to submit a new test
that catches it :-) Also, I&#8217;d love to hear about any successes you
have with Test::Unit, and any documentation you might add will be greatly
appreciated. My contact info is below.
</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>
A lot of discussion happens about Ruby in general on the ruby-talk mailing
list (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ml.html), and you can ask any questions
you might have there. I monitor the list, as do many other helpful
Rubyists, and you&#8217;re sure to get a quick answer. Of course,
you&#8217;re also welcome to email me (Nathaniel Talbott) directly at
mailto:testunit@talbott.ws, and I&#8217;ll do my best to help you out.
</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
I&#8217;d like to thank&#8230;
</p>
<p>
Matz, for a great language!
</p>
<p>
Masaki Suketa, for his work on RubyUnit, which filled a vital need in the
Ruby world for a very long time. I&#8217;m also grateful for his help in
polishing Test::Unit and getting the RubyUnit compatibility layer right.
His graciousness in allowing Test::Unit to supercede RubyUnit continues to
be a challenge to me to be more willing to defer my own rights.
</p>
<p>
Ken McKinlay, for his interest and work on unit testing, and for his
willingness to dialog about it. He was also a great help in pointing out
some of the holes in the RubyUnit compatibility layer.
</p>
<p>
Dave Thomas, for the original idea that led to the extremely simple
&quot;require &#8216;test/unit&#8217;&quot;, plus his code to improve it
even more by allowing the selection of tests from the command-line. Also,
without RDoc, the documentation for Test::Unit would stink a lot more than
it does now.
</p>
<p>
Everyone who&#8217;s helped out with bug reports, feature ideas,
encouragement to continue, etc. It&#8217;s a real privilege to be a part of
the Ruby community.
</p>
<p>
The guys at RoleModel Software, for putting up with me repeating, &quot;But
this would be so much easier in Ruby!&quot; whenever we&#8217;re coding in
Java.
</p>
<p>
My Creator, for giving me life, and giving it more abundantly.

<hr size="2"></hr><h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
The general idea behind unit testing is that you write a <em>test</em>
<em>method</em> that makes certain <em>assertions</em> about your code,
working against a <em>test</em> <em>fixture</em>. A bunch of these
<em>test</em> <em>methods</em> are bundled up into a <em>test</em>
<em>suite</em> and can be run any time the developer wants. The results of
a run are gathered in a <em>test</em> <em>result</em> and displayed to the
user through some UI. So, lets break this down and see how Test::Unit
provides each of these necessary pieces.
</p>
<h2>Assertions</h2>
<p>
These are the heart of the framework. Think of an assertion as a statement
of expected outcome, i.e. &quot;I assert that x should be equal to y&quot;.
If, when the assertion is executed, it turns out to be correct, nothing
happens, and life is good. If, on the other hand, your assertion turns out
to be false, an error is propagated with pertinent information so that you
can go back and make your assertion succeed, and, once again, life is good.
For an explanation of the current assertions, see Test::Unit::Assertions.
</p>
<h2>Test Method &amp; Test Fixture</h2>
<p>
Obviously, these assertions have to be called within a context that knows
about them and can do something meaningful with their pass/fail value.
Also, it&#8217;s handy to collect a bunch of related tests, each test
represented by a method, into a common test class that knows how to run
them. The tests will be in a separate class from the code they&#8217;re
testing for a couple of reasons. First of all, it allows your code to stay
uncluttered with test code, making it easier to maintain. Second, it allows
the tests to be stripped out for deployment, since they&#8217;re really
there for you, the developer, and your users don&#8217;t need them. Third,
and most importantly, it allows you to set up a common test fixture for
your tests to run against.
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s a test fixture? Well, tests do not live in a vacuum; rather,
they&#8217;re run against the code they are testing. Often, a collection of
tests will run against a common set of data, also called a fixture. If
they&#8217;re all bundled into the same test class, they can all share the
setting up and tearing down of that data, eliminating unnecessary
duplication and making it much easier to add related tests.
</p>
<p>
Test::Unit::TestCase wraps up a collection of test methods together and
allows you to easily set up and tear down the same test fixture for each
test. This is done by overriding #setup and/or #teardown, which will be
called before and after each test method that is run. The TestCase also
knows how to collect the results of your assertions into a
Test::Unit::TestResult, which can then be reported back to you&#8230; but
I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. To write a test, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Test::Unit is in your library path.

</li>
<li>require &#8216;test/unit&#8217; in your test script.

</li>
<li>Create a class that subclasses Test::Unit::TestCase.

</li>
<li>Add a method that begins with &quot;test&quot; to your class.

</li>
<li>Make assertions in your test method.

</li>
<li>Optionally define #setup and/or #teardown to set up and/or tear down your
common test fixture.

</li>
<li>You can now run your test as you would any other Ruby script&#8230; try it
and see!

</li>
</ul>
<p>
A really simple test might look like this (#setup and #teardown are
commented out to indicate that they are completely optional):
</p>
<pre class="code">
    <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'test/unit'</span>

    <span class='class class kw'>class</span> <span class='TC_MyTest constant id'>TC_MyTest</span> <span class='lt op'>&lt;</span> <span class='Test constant id'>Test</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Unit constant id'>Unit</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='TestCase constant id'>TestCase</span>
      <span class='comment val'># def setup</span>
      <span class='comment val'># end</span>

      <span class='comment val'># def teardown</span>
      <span class='comment val'># end</span>

      <span class='def def kw'>def</span> <span class='test_fail identifier id'>test_fail</span>
        <span class='assert identifier id'>assert</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='false false kw'>false</span><span class='comma token'>,</span> <span class='string val'>'Assertion was false.'</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span>
      <span class='end end kw'>end</span>
    <span class='end end kw'>end</span>
</pre>
<h2>Test Runners</h2>
<p>
So, now you have this great test class, but you still need a way to run it
and view any failures that occur during the run. This is where
Test::Unit::UI::Console::TestRunner (and others, such as
Test::Unit::UI::GTK::TestRunner) comes into play. The console test runner
is automatically invoked for you if you require &#8216;test/unit&#8217; and
simply run the file. To use another runner, or to manually invoke a runner,
simply call its run class method and pass in an object that responds to the
suite message with a Test::Unit::TestSuite. This can be as simple as
passing in your TestCase class (which has a class suite method). It might
look something like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">
   <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'test/unit/ui/console/testrunner'</span>
   <span class='Test constant id'>Test</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Unit constant id'>Unit</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='UI constant id'>UI</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Console constant id'>Console</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='TestRunner constant id'>TestRunner</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='run identifier id'>run</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='TC_MyTest constant id'>TC_MyTest</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span>
</pre>
<h2>Test Suite</h2>
<p>
As more and more unit tests accumulate for a given project, it becomes a
real drag running them one at a time, and it also introduces the potential
to overlook a failing test because you forget to run it. Suddenly it
becomes very handy that the TestRunners can take any object that returns a
Test::Unit::TestSuite in response to a suite method. The TestSuite can, in
turn, contain other TestSuites or individual tests (typically created by a
TestCase). In other words, you can easily wrap up a group of TestCases and
TestSuites like this:
</p>
<pre class="code">
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'test/unit/testsuite'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'tc_myfirsttests'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'tc_moretestsbyme'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'ts_anothersetoftests'</span>

 <span class='class class kw'>class</span> <span class='TS_MyTests constant id'>TS_MyTests</span>
   <span class='def def kw'>def</span> <span class='self self kw'>self</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span>
     <span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span> <span class='assign token'>=</span> <span class='Test constant id'>Test</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Unit constant id'>Unit</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='TestSuite constant id'>TestSuite</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='new identifier id'>new</span>
     <span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span> <span class='lshft op'>&lt;&lt;</span> <span class='TC_MyFirstTests constant id'>TC_MyFirstTests</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span>
     <span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span> <span class='lshft op'>&lt;&lt;</span> <span class='TC_MoreTestsByMe constant id'>TC_MoreTestsByMe</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span>

     <span class='return return kw'>return</span> <span class='suite identifier id'>suite</span>
   <span class='end end kw'>end</span>
 <span class='end end kw'>end</span>
 <span class='Test constant id'>Test</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Unit constant id'>Unit</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='UI constant id'>UI</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='Console constant id'>Console</span><span class='colon2 op'>::</span><span class='TestRunner constant id'>TestRunner</span><span class='dot token'>.</span><span class='run identifier id'>run</span><span class='lparen token'>(</span><span class='TS_MyTests constant id'>TS_MyTests</span><span class='rparen token'>)</span>
</pre>
<p>
Now, this is a bit cumbersome, so Test::Unit does a little bit more for
you, by wrapping these up automatically when you require
&#8216;test/unit&#8217;. What does this mean? It means you could write the
above test case like this instead:
</p>
<pre class="code">
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'test/unit'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'tc_myfirsttests'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'tc_moretestsbyme'</span>
 <span class='require identifier id'>require</span> <span class='string val'>'ts_anothersetoftests'</span>
</pre>
<p>
Test::Unit is smart enough to find all the test cases existing in the
ObjectSpace and wrap them up into a suite for you. It then runs the dynamic
suite using the console TestRunner.
</p>
