Translate
</p>
<h6>===</h6>
<p>
This plugin provides a web interface for translating Rails I18n texts
(requires Rails 2.2 or higher) from one locale to another. The plugin has
been tested only with the simple I18n backend that ships with Rails. I18n
texts are read from and written to YAML files under config/locales.
</p>
<p>
To translate to a new locale you need to add a YAML file for that locale
that contains the locale as the top key and at least one translation.
</p>
<p>
Please note that there are certain I18n keys that map to Array objects
rather than strings and those are currently not dealt with by the
translation UI. This means that Rails built in keys such as date.day_names
need to be translated manually directly in the YAML file.
</p>
<p>
To get the translation UI to write the YAML files in UTF8 you need to
install the ya2yaml gem.
</p>
<p>
The translation UI finds all I18n keys by extracting them from I18n lookups
in your application source code. In addition it adds all :en and default
locale keys from the I18n backend.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated: Each string in the UI now has an &quot;Auto Translate&quot; link
which will send the original text to Google Translate and will input the
returned translation into the form field for further clean up and review
prior to saving.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rake Tasks
</p>
<h6>===</h6>
<p>
In addition to the web UI this plugin adds the following rake tasks:
</p>
<p>
translate:lost_in_translation translate:merge_keys translate:google
</p>
<p>
The lost_in_translation task shows you any I18n keys in your code that are
do not have translations in the YAML file for your default locale, i.e.
config/locales/sv.yml.
</p>
<p>
The merge_keys task is supposed to be used in conjunction with Sven
Fuch&#8217;s Rails I18n TextMate bundle
(http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master). Texts and keys
extracted with the TextMate bundle end up in the temporary file
log/translations.yml. When you run the merge_keys rake task the keys are
moved over to the corresponding I18n locale file, i.e.
config/locales/sv.yml. The merge_keys task also checks for overwrites of
existing keys by warning you that one of your extracted keys already exists
with a different translation.
</p>
<p>
The google task is used for auto translating from one locale to another
using Google Translate.
